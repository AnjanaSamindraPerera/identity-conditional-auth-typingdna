You can either download the TypingDNA artifacts or build the authenticator from the source code.
1. To download the Github artifacts:  
i. Stop WSO2 Identity Server if it is already running.   
ii. Download the [TypingDNA connector]() & add it to `IS-Home/repository/components/dropins` folder.    
iii. Download the [TypingDNA API]() and add it to `IS-Home/repository/deployment/server/webapps` folder.  
  

2. To build from the source code.

ii. To build the authenticator, navigate to the identity-conditional-auth-typingdna directory and execute the following 
   command in a command prompt.  
   ```mvn clean install```

   Note that the `org.wso2.carbon.identity.conditional.auth.typingdna.functions-x.x.x.jar` file is created in 
   the `components/org.wso2.carbon.identity.conditional.auth.typingdna.functions` directory and 
   `api#typingdna#v_.war` file is created in the `components/org.wso2.carbon.identity.conditional.auth.typingdna.api` 
   directory.  
   Copy the `org.wso2.carbon.identity.conditional.auth.typingdna.functions-x.x.x.jar` file into the 
   `<IS-Home>/repository/components/dropins directory` and `api#typingdna#v_.war` file into the
   `<IS-Home>/repository/deployment/server/webapps`
