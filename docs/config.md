* [Installing the connector & extensions](#installing-the-connector--extensions)
* [Setting up the TypingDNA account](#setting-up-the-typingdna-account)
* [Configuring the TypingDNA in WSO2 Identity Server](#configuring-the-typingdna-in-wso2-identity-server)
* [Configuring the application to use TypingDNA](#configuring-the-application-to-use-typingdna)

### Installing the connector & extensions  

#### Adding plugins to authentication endpoint.

1. Download the TypingDNA connector and other required artifacts from the [WSO2 store](https://store.wso2.com/store/assets/isconnector/list).
3. Copy the files inside plugins folder and paste them to `<IS-Home>/repository/deployment/server/webapps/authenticationendpoint/plugins` directory.
4. Copy the `typing-dna.js` file to `<IS-Home>/repository/deployment/server/webapps/authenticationendpoint/js` directory.

#### Enable TypingDNA in the WSO2 Identity Server.

1. Stop WSO2 Identity Server if it is already running.
2. Add the below configuration in the `<IS-Home>/repository/conf/deployment.toml` file.
   
    ```
   [myaccount.security]
    enabled_features=["security.loginVerifyData.typingDNA"]
   ```

#### Deploying TypingDNA Artifacts.

You can either download the TypingDNA artifacts or build the authenticator from the source code.

1. To download the Github artifacts:  
  i. Stop WSO2 Identity Server if it is already running.   
  ii. Download the TypingDNA connector and other required artifacts from the [WSO2 store](https://store.wso2.com/store/assets/isconnector/list).  
  iii. Copy the `org.wso2.carbon.identity.conditional.auth.typingdna.functions-x.x.x.jar` file into the `<IS-Home>/repository/components/dropins` directory.   
  iv. Copy the `api#identity#typingdna#v_.war` file into the `<IS-Home>/repository/deployment/server/webapps` directory.

2. To build from the source code.  
  i. Stop WSO2 Identity Server if it is already running.  
  ii. To build the authenticator, navigate to the identity-conditional-auth-typingdna directory and execute the following 
   command in a command prompt.  
   
   ```
   mvn clean install
   ```

   * Note that the `org.wso2.carbon.identity.conditional.auth.typingdna.functions-x.x.x.jar` file is created in the `components/org.wso2.carbon.identity.conditional.auth.typingdna.functions/target` directory. 
   * `api#identity#typingdna#v_.war` file is created in the `components/org.wso2.carbon.identity.conditional.auth.typingdna.api/target` 
   directory.  
   
   * Copy the `org.wso2.carbon.identity.conditional.auth.typingdna.functions-x.x.x.jar` file into the 
   `<IS-Home>/repository/components/dropins directory` and `api#identity#typingdna#v_.war` file into the
